## About
The project's goal is to write a CLI tool to compress and decompress files using the OCaml programming language that was learnt on **Introduction to Functional Programming** course taught by the professor **Kim Nguyá»…n** [link](https://usr.lmf.cnrs.fr/~kn/index_en.html)

## Setup
1. Make sure you have __ocaml__ and __dune__ installed on your machine
2. Clone the project `git clone https://framagit.org/ykorote/project_ocaml`
3. Enter into the folder `cd projet_ocaml`
4. Execute the file, for example to see the help, write: `dune exec ./huff.exe --help`
