## About
The project's goal is to write a CLI tool to compress and decompress files using the OCaml programming language that was learnt on **Introduction to Functional Programming** course taught by the professor **Kim Nguyá»…n** [link](https://usr.lmf.cnrs.fr/~kn/index_en.html)

## Setup
1. Make sure you have __ocaml__ and __dune__ installed on your machine
2. Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/DobbiKov/project_ipf`
3. Enter into the folder `cd project_ipf`
4. Write `dune build` to compile the project
5. Run `./_build/default/huff.exe`
